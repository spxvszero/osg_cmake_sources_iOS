This is the [openscenegraph](https://www.openscenegraph.com/) make sources for iOS platform. The OpenSceneGraph git repo is : https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph



## How to use it

2. go into the dir, and git clone the openscenegraph repo in this

3. Edit `run.sh` file, and redirect the `export THIRDPARTY_PATH` 

   (Maybe you also need to edit `-DIPHONE_SDKVER="16.4"` with your local sdk version. You can run `xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-path` to get the version number.)

## Other Tips

* OSG report `Error, no WindowSystemInterface available, cannot create windows.`

  Use `USE_GRAPICSWINDOW_IMPLEMENTATION(IOS)`  under the `#include <osgDB/Registry>`

* `*.osgb` files could not read correctly

  Need  `USE_OSGPLUGIN(osg2)` and `USE_SERIALIZER_WRAPPER_LIBRARY(osg)` to import the plugin library.

  And the `*.osg` files use these `USE_OSGPLUGIN(osg)` and `USE_DOTOSGWRAPPER_LIBRARY(osg)`

* Add `USE_DOTOSGWRAPPER_LIBRARY(osg)` compile error.

  This statement will search `libosgdb_deprecated_osg.a` library. Make sure import it already. 

* Other Compile failed

  Add `OSG_LIBRARY_STATIC` to Preprocessor Macros may help.
